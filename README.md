Disclaimer: This style of contract hasn't been audited by formal methods. Please use at your own risk on mainnet.

This tutorial will demonstrate a naive approach toward writing a DSL for pyteal contracts. We employ a process of tokenisation by grouping the input text into various parts of the contract. We also apply these values dynamically through loops. This ensures that you can continue to write crafting contracts using a simple English like language.
